/includes      # header/footer
/assets        # CSS, JS, logo

index.php
calculators.php
scholarships.php
blog.php
contact.php
```

## Deploy
1. Upload the whole folder to your PHP host (or into repo and deploy to a PHP server).
2. Update `contact.php` recipient email (`$to`).
3. (Optional) Add your Google Analytics and AdSense snippets in `includes/header.php` and `includes/footer.php`.
4. Ensure `.php` is allowed and `mail()` works on your host. If not, integrate SMTP (e.g., PHPMailer) later.
